He pioneered the first fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm capable of extracting thousands of features from whole-slide pathology images. His research has uncovered molecular mechanisms driving the microscopic phenotypes of tumor cells and identified novel cellular morphologies that predict patient prognosis.</p>
				<p>Dr. Yu’s lab integrates multi-omics (e.g., genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) profiles with quantitative pathology patterns to predict clinical phenotypes in cancer patients. The AI methods developed by the Yu Lab have been independently validated by over 80 research laboratories worldwide.</p>
				<p>His contributions to AI in pathology have earned numerous honors, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award, Google Research Scholar Award, American Medical Informatics Association New Investigator Award, Harvard Medical School Dean’s Innovation Award, Department of Defense (DoD) Career Development Award, and the American Cancer Society (ACS) Research Scholar Award. He is a Fellow of the American Medical Informatics Association (FAMIA).</p>
